        "**1. What is a random variable in probability theory?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A random variable is a variable that takes numerical values based on the outcome of a random experiment. It helps us measure and analyze uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What are the types of random variables?**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two types: discrete (countable values like number of students) and continuous (measurable values like height or weight).\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrete distributions deal with specific values (like 0,1,2), while continuous distributions deal with any value in a range (like 0.5, 1.3, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "PDFs describe the likelihood of different outcomes for continuous random variables. The area under the curve shows probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDFs?**\n",
        "\n",
        "CDF gives the probability that a value is less than or equal to a certain point, while PDF shows the likelihood at each exact value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s a type of distribution where all outcomes are equally likely. Example: rolling a fair die (each number 1–6 has equal chance).\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Bernoulli distribution has only two outcomes: success (1) and failure (0), like flipping a coin once.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. Example: 3 heads in 5 coin tosses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. Common in modeling calls per minute in a call center.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It represents equal probability for all values in a given range. Example: picking a number randomly between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s symmetric, bell-shaped, and most data clusters around the mean. Mean = Median = Mode in a perfect normal curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. It simplifies calculations and is the basis for Z-scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?**\n",
        "\n",
        "CLT says that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as sample size increases, even if data isn't normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows us to use normal distribution to make inferences about population means, especially for large samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Z-statistics help test hypotheses by comparing sample data to population parameters using standard normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Z = (X - μ) / σ. It shows how many standard deviations a value is from the mean. Useful for comparing data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Point estimate gives a single value (like sample mean). Interval estimate gives a range (confidence interval) likely to contain the true value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?**\n",
        "\n",
        "They give a range where the true population value likely falls, offering more reliable insights than a single point estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Z-scores help build confidence intervals by defining the number of standard deviations around the mean to cover.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Z-scores standardize different datasets, so you can compare values on the same scale, even with different units or spreads.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Sample size should be large (usually n ≥ 30), and observations should be independent and identically distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Expected value is the average result of a random variable over many trials. It's like a long-term prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "It defines the possible outcomes and their probabilities, helping us calculate the expected (average) result.\n",
